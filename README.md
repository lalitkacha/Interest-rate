# Interest-rate
The project will use machine learning algorithms that leverage different determining factors of a loan applicant. Selection of significant factors will help develop a prediction algorithm which can estimate loan interest rates based on clients’ information. On one hand, knowing the factors will help consumers and borrowers to increase their credit worthiness and place themselves in a better position to negotiate for getting a lower interest rate. On the other hand, this will help lending companies to get an immediate fixed interest rate estimation based on client’s information. Here, our goal is to use a training dataset to predict the loan rate category (1 / 2 / 3) that will be assigned to each loan in our test set. We will use combination of the features in the dataset to make our loan rate category predictions.
